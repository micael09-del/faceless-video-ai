You are a professional web developer. Create a complete responsive sales page in HTML and CSS (no frameworks, clean code). The design must use the color palette: dark blue (#0A0F2C), purple (#6A0DAD), and black (#000000).

The sales page structure must include:

- Subheadline reinforcing the promise of the product.
- A “Buy Now” button linked to: https://pay.kiwify.com/0FtTjLR
- Space to embed a VSL (I will upload the video file later; put a placeholder <video> tag ready to replace with my VSL).

2. PRODUCT OFFER
